You may notice that this tensor should have another dimension due to the one-hot vectors, however PyTorch conveniently stores a one-hot vector as it's index value, i.e. the tensor representing a sentence is just a tensor of the indexes for each token in that sentence. The act of converting a list of tokens into a list of indexes is commonly called `numericalizing`.\n",
